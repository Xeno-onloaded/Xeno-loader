# Xeno-loader
Xeno-loader consists of three parts: Xeno-NLU + Xeno-robot-client + Xeno-robot-server.

The env of each part can be easily deployed via Docker Hub: `organwalk/xeno-robot-server`, `organwalk/xeno-robot-client` and `zepore/xeno_rasa`.

To describe more about how xeno-loader works, please wait for our release after the results of the 「"CHINA SOFTWARE CUP" COLLEGE STUDENT SOFTWARE DESIGN COMPETITION」.
